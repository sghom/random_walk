# random_walk
A random walk visualization

This repository contains a series of Python scripts demonstrating various data visualization techniques and custom class implementations. Below is a brief overview of the provided code:

1. Random Walk Visualization:
Script: random_walk_plot.py
Description: This script creates a random walk simulation using a custom RandomWalk class and visualizes the path using Matplotlib. The random walk is plotted with a grey line, and the start and end points are highlighted in green and red, respectively. The axes are hidden for a cleaner look.

2. Square Numbers Plot:
Script: square_numbers_plot.py
Description: This script generates a line plot of square numbers. It uses Matplotlib's 'seaborn' style to enhance the plot's aesthetics, sets a title, and labels the axes. The tick parameters are adjusted for better readability.

3. Enhanced Random Walk Visualization:
Script: enhanced_random_walk_plot.py
Description: This script extends the random walk visualization by increasing the number of points to 50,000. It uses a color gradient to represent the progression of the walk. The first and last points are highlighted, and the plot's DPI is set for higher resolution.

4. Scatter Plot of Square Numbers:
Script: scatter_square_numbers_plot.py
Description: This script creates a scatter plot of square numbers using Matplotlib. The points are color-coded based on their value, and the plot is saved as a PNG file. The axis ranges are set explicitly to frame the plot better.

5. Plotly Color Scales:
Script: plotly_colors.py
Description: This script prints out the names of available color scales from the Plotly library. It serves as a reference for choosing color scales in Plotly visualizations.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own visualization needs!
